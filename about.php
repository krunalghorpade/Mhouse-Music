                    Electronic Revolution</h1>
                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #fff;">Redefining Indian Electronic Music, One
                    Beat at a Time.</h2>

                <p>
                    M-House is more than just a record label; it is a sonic movement. Founded by the visionary DJ and
                    music producer Kratex, M-House was born from a singular mission: to take the vibrant, rhythmic soul
                    of Marathi music and fuse it with the high-energy pulse of global House and EDM.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are pioneering the "M-House" genre—a distinct sound that bridges the gap between the traditional
                    dhol-tasha pathaks of Maharashtra and the mainstages of international music festivals.

                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #fff;">The M-House Sound</h2>
                <p>
                    What defines the M-House sound? It is the alchemy of heritage and innovation. We strip away the
                    boundaries of regional music, blending raw Marathi folk vocals, Sambhal rhythms, and Halgi beats
                    with cutting-edge electronic synthesis, deep basslines, and modern house grooves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether it’s a high-octane club banger or a soulful melodic house track, our releases are designed
                    to resonate with audiences worldwide while staying deeply rooted in Indian culture.

                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #fff;">A Platform for Rising Talent</h2>
                <p>
                    M-House is dedicated to the next generation of artists. We believe that regional Indian talent
                    deserves a global spotlight. As a premier Indian record label, we act as an incubator for rising
                    producers, vocalists, and songwriters who are daring enough to experiment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We provide the platform, the distribution, and the guidance for artists to showcase their innovative
                    sounds, creating a community where cultural roots meet contemporary dance music.

                <h2 style="margin-bottom: 2rem; font-size: 1.5rem; color: #fff;">The Vision: From Local to Global</h2>
                <p>
                    Under the leadership of Kratex, M-House is pushing the envelope of what regional Indian music can
                    achieve. Our vision is clear: to ensure that when the world thinks of Indian Electronic Music, they
                    hear the thump of Maharashtra.

                    Join the movement. Experience the fusion. Welcome to M-House.
