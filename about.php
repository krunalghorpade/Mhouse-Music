                    It started in a small room in Pune, with nothing but a laptop and a deep obsession with the rhythm
                    of Maharashtra. <span class="highlight">M-House Music</span> wasn't born in a boardroom; it was born
                    on the dancefloor, in the chaos of the Ganpati Visarjan, and in the silence of the studio at 4 AM.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We realized that the world was listening to House, Techno, and Trance, but they hadn't heard the
                    soul of India yet. Not the Bollywood remixes, but the raw, unfiltered beat of the <span
                        class="highlight">Nashik Dhol</span> fused with the industrial precision of Berlin Techno.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <span class="highlight">Kratex</span> founded this label with a singular vision: to create a sound
                    that is undeniably Indian and unapologetically global. We don't just release music; we curate
                    experiences. We bridge the gap between the traditional folk instruments of the Sahyadris and the
                    synthesizers of tomorrow.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is distinct. This is loud. This is <span class="highlight">M-House</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We are a collective of producers, DJs, and visual artists pushing the boundaries of what "Indian
                    Electronic Music" can mean. From deep, melodic soundscapes to high-octane festival anthems, our
                    catalog is a testament to the versatility of our culture.
